# What is a ZorkBot?
This repo holds the Codebase for the node.js based  [Microsoft Bot Framework][1]. application that I  built to play Zork, The Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy, and a series of other InfoCom classic Interactive Fiction titles.

On top of a series of manual optimizations that are made before any command from the user hits the server, ZorkBot leverages a series of models that I have trained for [LUIS.ai][11] to help concert human speech down to commands that these games can better comprehend.

For those with a screen through which they can interface with this app via Skype, the Cortana app for Windows, Android, iOS, Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, Slack, or any other, I highly recommend it.  This application has been built with a screenless interface in mind, but due to a series of interactive cards that I have built for choice prompts, this application can be much more enjoyable with a screen.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js][4] version 10.14 or higher
    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```
# To run the bot locally
- Download the bot code from the Build blade in the Azure Portal (make sure you click "Yes" when asked "Include app settings in the downloaded zip file?").
    - If you clicked "No" you will need to copy all the Application Settings properties from your App Service to your local .env file.
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Run the bot
    ```bash
    npm start

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.3.0 or greater from [here][6]

## Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

# Deploy the bot to Azure
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.
To learn how, see [Deploy your bot to Azure][40] for a complete set of deployment instructions.
